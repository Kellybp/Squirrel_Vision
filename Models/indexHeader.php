<!--Here, all this is brought over just as before
However, something really cool happens here because you can see my comments in the inspector
but you cannot see any of my earlier comments
This is becuase the other comments are occuring on the server side and the client side will not see them
HTML however, is client side, so a client will be able to see this comment-->
